    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import hypot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-hypot@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### hypot( x, y )

Computes the [hypotenuse][hypotenuse] avoiding overflow and underflow.

```javascript
var h = hypot( -5.0, 12.0 );
// returns 13.0

h = hypot( -0.0, -0.0 );
// returns +0.0
```

If either argument is `NaN`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var h = hypot( NaN, 12.0 );
// returns NaN

h = hypot( 5.0, NaN );
// returns NaN
```

## Notes

-   The textbook approach to calculating the hypotenuse is subject to overflow and underflow. For example, for a sufficiently large `x` and/or `y`, computing the hypotenuse will overflow.

    ```javascript
    import sqrt from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-sqrt@esm/index.mjs';

    var x2 = 1.0e154 * 1.0e154;
    // returns 1.0e308

    var h = sqrt( x2 + x2 );
    // returns Infinity
    ```

    Similarly, for sufficiently small `x` and/or `y`, computing the hypotenuse will underflow.

    ```javascript
    import sqrt from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-sqrt@esm/index.mjs';

    var x2 = 1.0e-200 * 1.0e-200;
    // returns 0.0

    var h = sqrt( x2 + x2 );
    // returns 0.0
    ```

    This implementation uses a numerically stable algorithm which avoids overflow and underflow.

    ```javascript
    var h = hypot( 1.0e154, 1.0e154 );
    // returns ~1.4142e+154

    h = hypot( 1.0e-200, 1.0e-200 );
    // returns ~1.4142e-200
    ```
